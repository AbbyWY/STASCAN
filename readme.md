# STASCAN
![](./STASCAN_overview.png)


## Overview
STASCAN is an AI-driven method that simultaneously utilizes the gene expression and the morphological information to depict fine-resolved cell distribution of the captured domains and even gap regions. 

STASCAN can also enable cell-type predictions at subdivide-spot resolution and predict cell distribution in 3D space from histology images alone. 


## Hardware dependencies
STASCAN can run on CPU-only hardware, but training new models will take exceedingly long.

We recommend running STASCAN on a GPU hardware.


## Software dependencies
