# STASCAN
![](./STASCAN_overview.png)

## Overview
STASCAN is an AI-driven method that simultaneously utilizes the gene expression and the morphological information to depict fine-resolved cell distribution of the captured domains and even gap regions. 
STASCAN can also enable cell-type predictions at subdivide-spot resolution and predict cell distribution in 3D space from histology images alone.
